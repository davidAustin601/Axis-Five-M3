Hi {Name},
 
This is Chris Austin from Student Counseling Services. I see that you and I are scheduled to meet for our intake {Date} at {Time}. In preparation for our meeting, I’m going to need for you to complete our initial appointment paperwork (link below). It shouldn’t take too much time but if you have any questions or concerns about it just let me know and we will get it figured out. With regard to the actual meeting, all you have to do is follow the second link below. You should be able to do it on the phone, laptop, or tablet. It’s a pretty simple process actually and really shouldn’t require anything extra to join. We do ask, however, the you make sure to have your student ID card with you and to be in a safe / confidential space when we begin. Additionally, I will ask for a little bit of information when we get started such as address where you are during the meeting, phone number in case we get disconnected, as well as emergency contact information.

I apologize if this was a lot of information or if it was confusing - either way let me know if you have any questions and we will go from there.

Thanks and Take Care,
